BACKGROUND	This study analyzed liver function abnormalities in heart failure patients admitted with severe acute decompensated heart failure ( ADHF ) .
RESULTS	A post hoc analysis was conducted with the use of data from the Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness ( ESCAPE ) .
RESULTS	Liver function tests ( LFTs ) were measured at 7 time points from baseline , at discharge , and up to 6 months follow-up .
RESULTS	Survival analyses were used to assess the association between admission Model of End-Stage Liver Disease Excluding International Normalized Ratio ( MELD-XI ) scores and patient outcome.There was a high prevalence of abnormal baseline ( admission ) LFTs ( albumin 23.8 % , aspartate transaminase 23.5 % , alanine transaminase 23.8 % , and total bilirubin 36.1 % ) .
RESULTS	The percentage of patients with abnormal LFTs decreased significantly from baseline to 6-months ' follow-up .
RESULTS	When mean hemodynamic profiles were compared in patients with abnormal versus normal LFTs , elevated total bilirubin was associated with a significantly lower cardiac index ( 1.80 vs 2.1 ; P < .001 ) and higher central venous pressure ( 14.2 vs 12.0 ; P = .03 ) .
RESULTS	Multivariable analyses revealed that patients with elevated MELD-XI scores ( 16.8 ) had a 2-fold ( hazard ratio2 .06 , 95 % confidence interval 1.05-4 .03 ) increased risk of death , rehospitalization , or transplantation after adjusting for baseline LFTs , age , sex , race , body mass index , diabetes , and systolic blood pressure .
CONCLUSIONS	Abnormal LFTs are common in the ADHF population and are a dynamic marker of an impaired hemodynamic state .
CONCLUSIONS	Elevated MELD-XI scores are associated with poor outcomes among patients admitted with ADHF .

BACKGROUND	Minimally invasive endovascular aneurysm repair ( EVAR ) could be a surgical technique that improves outcome of patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm ( rAAA ) .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to analyse the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of EVAR compared with standard open repair ( OR ) in the treatment of rAAA , with costs per 30-day and 6-month survivor as outcome parameters .
METHODS	Resource use was determined from the Amsterdam Acute Aneurysm ( AJAX ) trial , a multicentre randomized trial comparing EVAR with OR in patients with rAAA .
METHODS	The analysis was performed from a provider perspective .
METHODS	All costs were calculated as if all patients had been treated in the same hospital ( Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis , teaching hospital ) .
RESULTS	A total of 116 patients were randomized .
RESULTS	The 30-day mortality rate was 21 per cent after EVAR and 25 per cent for OR : absolute risk reduction ( ARR ) 44 ( 95 per cent confidence interval ( c.i. ) -110 to 197 ) per cent .
RESULTS	At 6months , the total mortality rate for EVAR was 28 per cent , compared with 31 per cent among those assigned to OR : ARR 24 ( -142 to 190 ) per cent .
RESULTS	The mean cost difference between EVAR and OR was 5306 ( 95 per cent c.i. -1854 to 12,659 ) at 30days and 10,189 ( -2477 to 24,506 ) at 6months .
RESULTS	The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per prevented death was 120,591 at 30days and 424,542 at 6months .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in quality of life between EVAR and OR .
RESULTS	Nor was EVAR superior regarding cost-utility .
CONCLUSIONS	EVAR may be more effective for rAAA , but its increased costs mean that it is unaffordable based on current standards of societal willingness-to-pay for health gains .

BACKGROUND	Evidence suggests that individuals with social anxiety demonstrate vigilance to social threat , whilst the peptide hormone oxytocin is widely accepted as supporting affiliative behaviour in humans .
METHODS	This study investigated whether oxytocin can affect attentional bias in social anxiety .
METHODS	In a double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled , within-group study design , 26 healthy and 16 highly socially anxious ( HSA ) male volunteers ( within the HSA group , 10 were diagnosed with generalized social anxiety disorder ) were administered 24 IU of oxytocin or placebo to investigate attentional processing in social anxiety .
METHODS	Attentional bias was assessed using the dot-probe paradigm with angry , fearful , happy and neutral face stimuli .
RESULTS	In the baseline placebo condition , the HSA group showed greater attentional bias for emotional faces than healthy individuals .
RESULTS	Oxytocin reduced the difference between HSA and non-socially anxious individuals in attentional bias for emotional faces .
RESULTS	Moreover , it appeared to normalize attentional bias in HSA individuals to levels seen in the healthy population in the baseline condition .
RESULTS	The biological mechanisms by which oxytocin may be exerting these effects are discussed .
CONCLUSIONS	These results , coupled with previous research , could indicate a potential therapeutic use of this hormone in treatment for social anxiety .

BACKGROUND	Exposure to diesel exhaust causes inflammatory responses .
BACKGROUND	Previous controlled exposure studies at a concentration of 300 g/m ( 3 ) of diesel exhaust particles mainly lasted for 1 h.
BACKGROUND	We prolonged the exposure period and investigated how quickly diesel exhaust can induce respiratory and systemic effects .
METHODS	Eighteen healthy volunteers were exposed twice to diluted diesel exhaust ( PM1 ~ 300 g/m ( 3 ) ) and twice to filtered air ( PM1 ~ 2 g/m ( 3 ) ) for 3 h , seated , in a chamber with a double-blind set-up .
METHODS	Immediately before and after exposure , we performed a medical examination , spirometry , rhinometry , nasal lavage and blood sampling .
METHODS	Nasal lavage and blood samples were collected again 20 h post-exposure .
METHODS	Symptom scores and peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) were assessed before exposure , and at 15 , 75 , and 135 min of exposure .
RESULTS	Self-rated throat irritation was higher during diesel exhaust than filtered air exposure .
RESULTS	Clinical signs of irritation in the upper airways were also significantly more common after diesel exhaust exposure ( odds ratio = 3.2 , p < 0.01 ) .
RESULTS	PEF increased during filtered air , but decreased during diesel exhaust exposure , with a statistically significant difference at 75 min ( +4 L/min vs. -10 L/min , p = 0.005 ) .
RESULTS	Monocyte and total leukocyte counts in peripheral blood were higher after exposure to diesel exhaust than filtered air 20 h post-exposure , and a trend ( p = 0.07 ) towards increased serum IL-6 concentrations was also observed 20 h post-exposure .
CONCLUSIONS	Diesel exhaust induced acute adverse effects such as symptoms and signs of irritation , decreased PEF , inflammatory markers in healthy volunteers .
CONCLUSIONS	The effects were first seen at 75 min of exposure .

OBJECTIVE	Depressive disorders are one of the leading components of the global burden of disease with a prevalence of up to 14 % in the general population .
OBJECTIVE	Numerous studies have demonstrated that pharmacotherapy combined with non-pharmacological measures offer the best treatment approach .
OBJECTIVE	Psycho-education as an intervention has been studied mostly in disorders such as schizophrenia and dementia , less so in depressive disorders .
OBJECTIVE	The present study aimed to assess the impact of psycho-education of patients and their caregivers on the outcome of depression .
METHODS	A total of 80 eligible depressed subjects were recruited and randomised into 2 groups .
METHODS	The study group involved an eligible family member and all were offered individual structured psycho-educational modules .
METHODS	Another group ( controls ) received routine counselling .
METHODS	The subjects in both groups also received routine pharmacotherapy and counselling from the treating clinician and were assessed at baseline , 2 , 4 , 8 , and 12 weeks using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ) , Global Assessment of Functioning ( GAF ) , and Psychological General Well-Being Index ( PGWBI ) .
METHODS	Results from both groups were compared using statistical methods including Chi-square test , Fisher 's exact test , Student 's t test , Pearson 's correlation coefficient , as well as univariate and multiple regression analyses .
RESULTS	Baseline socio-demographic and assessment measures were similar in both groups .
RESULTS	The study group had consistent improvement in terms of outcome measures with HDRS , GAF , and PGWBI scores showing respective mean change of -15.08 , 22 , and 60 over 12 weeks .
RESULTS	The comparable respective changes in the controls were -8.77 , 18.1 , and 43.25 .
CONCLUSIONS	Structured psycho-education combined with pharmacotherapy is an effective intervention for people with depressive disorders .
CONCLUSIONS	Psycho-education optimises the pharmacological treatment of depression in terms of faster recovery , reduction in severity of depression , and improvement in subjective wellbeing and social functioning .

OBJECTIVE	A pharmacokinetic substudy was conducted within a phase 3 clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of two leuprolide acetate 3-month depot formulations in children with central precocious puberty ( CPP ) , where the pharmacokinetics of leuprolide and the exposure-response relationship between leuprolide concentration and the probability of luteinizing hormone ( LH ) suppression were assessed .
METHODS	Children diagnosed with CPP ( N = 42 in each dosing cohort ) , who were treatment nave or previously treated , received a total of two intramuscular injections of either leuprolide acetate depot 11.25 or 30 mg formulations administered 3 months apart .
METHODS	Serial blood samples were collected for leuprolide concentration determination in a subset of subjects ( N = 24 in each cohort ) .
METHODS	One-way analysis of covariance was used to assess dose proportionality .
METHODS	The probability of LH suppression ( peak-stimulated LH concentrations < 4 mIU/mL ) exposure-response relationship was modelled using repeated measures logistic regression .
METHODS	The predicted probability of LH suppression and the corresponding 95 % confidence interval at the mean leuprolide concentration of each dose group and at each time of measurement were computed .
RESULTS	Mean leuprolide concentrations between weeks 4 and 12 for 11.25 and 30 mg doses were relatively constant and dose proportional , with no accumulation of leuprolide upon repeated administration .
RESULTS	Body weight and age were not found to be significant covariates on leuprolide pharmacokinetics .
RESULTS	Higher leuprolide concentrations were associated with higher probability of LH suppression and both doses provided LH suppression levels < 4 mIU/mL .
CONCLUSIONS	Leuprolide pharmacokinetics were characterized for 11.25 and 30 mg 3-month depot injections .
CONCLUSIONS	An exposure-response model was developed to link leuprolide concentrations and probability of peak-stimulated LH suppression .

OBJECTIVE	To determine whether alcohol consumption is causally associated with cognitive impairment in older men as predicted by mendelian randomization .
METHODS	Retrospective analysis of a cohort study of 3,542 community-dwelling men aged 65 to 83 years followed for 6 years .
METHODS	Cognitive impairment was established by a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 23 or less .
METHODS	Participants provided detailed information about their use of alcohol during the preceding year and were classified as abstainers , occasional drinkers , and regular drinkers : mild ( < 15 drinks/wk ) , moderate ( 15-27 drinks/wk ) , heavy ( 28-34 drinks/wk ) , and abusers ( 35 drinks/wk ) .
METHODS	We genotyped the rs1229984 GA variant of the alcohol dehydrogenase 1B ( ADH1B ) gene , which is associated with lower prevalence of alcohol abuse and dependence .
METHODS	Other measures included age , education , marital status , smoking and physical activity , body mass index , diabetes , hypertension , and cardiovascular diseases .
RESULTS	At study entry , rs1229984 GA polymorphism was associated with lower prevalence of regular use of alcohol and decreased consumption among regular users .
RESULTS	Six years later , 502 men ( 14.2 % ) showed evidence of cognitive impairment .
RESULTS	Abstainers and irregular drinkers had higher odds of cognitive impairment than regular drinkers ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 1.23 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 1.00-1 .51 , after adjustment for other measured factors ) .
RESULTS	The rs1229984 GA polymorphism did not decrease the odds of cognitive impairment ( AA/GG OR = 1.35 , 95 % CI = 0.29-6 .27 ; GA/GG OR = 1.05 , 95 % CI = 0.71-1 .55 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Alcohol consumption , including heavy regular drinking and abuse , is not a direct cause of cognitive impairment in later life .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results are consistent with the possibility , but do not prove , that regular moderate drinking decreases the risk of cognitive impairment in older men .

BACKGROUND	Detoxification with psychosocial counseling remains a standard opioid-use disorder treatment practice but is associated with poor outcomes .
BACKGROUND	This study tested the efficacy of a newly developed psychosocial intervention , Community Reinforcement Approach and Family Training for Treatment Retention ( CRAFT-T ) , relative to psychosocial treatment as usual ( TAU ) , for improving treatment outcomes .
METHODS	A randomized , 14-week trial with follow-up visits at 6 and 9 months post-randomization conducted at two substance use disorder ( SUD ) treatment programs .
METHODS	Opioid-dependent adults ( i.e. , identified patient - IP ) enrolled in a residential buprenorphine-detoxification program and their identified concerned significant other ( CSO ) was randomized to CRAFT-T ( n = 28 dyads ) or TAU ( n = 24 dyads ) .
METHODS	CRAFT-T consisted of two sessions with the IP and CSO together and 10 with the CSO alone , over 14 weeks .
METHODS	TAU for the CSOs was primarily educational and referral to self-help .
METHODS	All IPs received treatment as usually provided by the SUD program in which they were enrolled .
METHODS	The primary outcome was time to first IP drop from treatment lasting 30 days or more .
METHODS	Opioid and other drug use were key secondary outcomes .
RESULTS	CRAFT-T resulted in a moderate but non-significant effect on treatment retention ( p = 0.058 , hazard ratio = 0.57 ) .
RESULTS	When the CSO was parental family , CRAFT-T had a large and significant effect on treatment retention ( p < 0.01 , hazard ratio = .040 ) .
RESULTS	CRAFT-T had a significant positive effect on IP opioid and other drug use ( p < 0.0001 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	CRAFT-T is a promising treatment for opioid use disorder but replication is needed to confirm these results .

BACKGROUND	Characterization of the variations in the metabolomic profiles of elderly people is a necessary step to understand changes associated with aging .
BACKGROUND	This study assessed whether diets with different fat quality and supplementation with coenzyme Q10 ( CoQ ) affect the metabolomic profile in urine analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy from elderly people .
METHODS	Ten participants received , in a cross-over design , four isocaloric diets for 4-week periods each : Mediterranean diet supplemented with CoQ ( Med + CoQ diet ) ; Mediterranean diet ; Western diet rich in saturated fat diet ; low-fat , high-carbohydrate diet enriched in n-3 polyunsaturated fat .
RESULTS	Multivariate analysis showed differences between diets when comparing Med + CoQ diet and saturated fat diet , with greater hippurate urine levels after Med + CoQ diet and higher phenylacetylglycine levels after saturated fat diet in women .
RESULTS	Following consumption of Med + CoQ , hippurate excretion was positively correlated with CoQ and - carotene plasma levels and inversely related to Nrf2 , thioredoxin , superoxide dismutase 1 , and gp91 ( phox ) subunit of NADPH oxidase gene expression .
RESULTS	After saturated fat diet consumption , phenylacetylglycine excretion was inversely related to CoQ plasma level and positively correlated with isoprostanes urinary level .
CONCLUSIONS	The association between hippurate excretion and antioxidant biomarkers along with the relationship between phenylacetylglycine excretion and oxidant biomarkers suggests that the long-term consumption of a Med + CoQ diet could be beneficial for healthy aging and a promising challenge in the prevention of processes related to chronic oxidative stress , such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disease .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the differences in the efficacy on lower limb motor function in children with spastic cerebral palsy between the combined therapeutic program of Jin three-needle therapy and MOTOmed intelligent motor training and the simple MOTOmed .
METHODS	Eighty children with spastic cerebral palsy were randomized into an observation group and a control group , 40 cases in each group .
METHODS	In the observation group , Jin three-needle therapy was used at four mind points , three brain points , three intelligent points , three temporal points , three knee points and three foot points , as well as Chengjin ( BL 56 ) , Chengshen ( BL 57 ) and the other .
METHODS	Additionally , MOTOmed was given in assistance with conventional rehabilitation training .
METHODS	In the control group , MOTOmed and the conventional rehabilitation training were adopted .
METHODS	In the two groups , the treatment was given once a day , 20 treatments made one session and there were 3 to 5 days at interval between the two sessions .
METHODS	The efficacy evaluation was performed after continuous 3 sessions of treatment .
METHODS	The gross motor function measure ( GMFM ) and modified Ashworth scale ( MAS ) were applied for the evaluation before and after treatment in the two groups .
RESULTS	After 3 sessions of treatment , GMFM score was increased apparently as compared with that before treatment in the two groups ( P < 0.01 , P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	After treatment , GMFM score in the observation group was increased more remarkably than that in the control group ( 55.32 + / - 17.10 vs 47.48 + / - 17.18 , P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	After treatment , the total effective rate of gastrocnemius Ashworth spasm grade [ 90.0 % ( 36/40 ) ] in the observation group was better apparently than [ 72.5 % ( 29/40 ) ] in the control group ( P < 0.05 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The combined therapeutic program of Jin three-needle therapy and MOTOmet intelligent motor training improves the lower limb motor function of the children with spastic cerebral palsy and its efficacy is better than simple MOTOmed .

BACKGROUND	Stenting is an alternative to endarterectomy for treatment of carotid artery stenosis , but long-term efficacy is uncertain .
BACKGROUND	We report long-term data from the randomised International Carotid Stenting Study comparison of these treatments .
METHODS	Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis were randomly assigned 1:1 to open treatment with stenting or endarterectomy at 50 centres worldwide .
METHODS	Randomisation was computer generated centrally and allocated by telephone call or fax .
METHODS	Major outcomes were assessed by an independent endpoint committee unaware of treatment assignment .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was fatal or disabling stroke in any territory after randomisation to the end of follow-up .
METHODS	Analysis was by intention to treat ( [ ITT ] all patients ) and per protocol from 31 days after treatment ( all patients in whom assigned treatment was completed ) .
METHODS	Functional ability was rated with the modified Rankin scale .
METHODS	This study is registered , number ISRCTN25337470 .
RESULTS	1713 patients were assigned to stenting ( n = 855 ) or endarterectomy ( n = 858 ) and followed up for a median of 42 years ( IQR 30-52 , maximum 100 ) .
RESULTS	Three patients withdrew immediately and , therefore , the ITT population comprised 1710 patients .
RESULTS	The number of fatal or disabling strokes ( 52 vs 49 ) and cumulative 5-year risk did not differ significantly between the stenting and endarterectomy groups ( 64 % vs 65 % ; hazard ratio [ HR ] 106 , 95 % CI 072-157 , p = 077 ) .
RESULTS	Any stroke was more frequent in the stenting group than in the endarterectomy group ( 119 vs 72 events ; ITT population , 5-year cumulative risk 152 % vs 94 % , HR 171 , 95 % CI 128-230 , p < 0001 ; per-protocol population , 5-year cumulative risk 89 % vs 58 % , 153 , 102-231 , p = 004 ) , but were mainly non-disabling strokes .
RESULTS	The distribution of modified Rankin scale scores at 1 year , 5 years , or final follow-up did not differ significantly between treatment groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Long-term functional outcome and risk of fatal or disabling stroke are similar for stenting and endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate the effect of central venous blood oxygen saturation ( ScvO2 ) and venous-arterial PCO2 ( P ( cv-a ) CO2 ) guided fluid therapy on tissue perfusion , gastrointestinal function recovering and outcome of the patients who undergoing open gastrointestinal surgery .
METHODS	Forty patients undergoing open gastrointestinal surgery were randomly divided into 2 groups ( n = 20 each ) : ScvO2 guided fluid therapy ( group S ) and P ( cv-a ) CO2 guided fluid therapy ( group P ) .
METHODS	All the patients were infused 10 ml/kg lactated Ringer 's ( LR ) solution before anesthesia induction , they were all also given a continuous lactated Ringer 's ( LR ) solution 's infusion at the speed of 2 mlkg ( -1 ) h ( -1 ) during the operation .
METHODS	While , 6 % HES 130/0 .4 ( free flex 6 % HES 130/0 .4 , Fresenius Kabi ) infusion was different between the 2 groups , when the patients of group S 's central venous blood oxygen saturation < 75 % or venous-arterial PCO2 in the patients of P group 6 mm Hg , then infused 6 % HES 130/0 .4 .
METHODS	Arterial and central venous blood gas analyses were performed every 20 minutes after skin incision , measure the venous and arterial lactate value , and record the anal exhaust time after surgery , postoperative complications and mortality in 28 days .
RESULTS	Compared with group S , the arterial lactate value in T4 ( after operation began 80 min ) were significantly decreased in group P ( P = 0.013 ) , and venous lactate value in T5 ( after operation began 100 min ) were also lower ( P = 0.044 ) , other lactate value were not different ( P > 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	The anal exhaust time was not different between the two groups ( P = 0.673 ) .
RESULTS	All the patients were survival , and there were no obvious postoperative complications .
CONCLUSIONS	Compared to group S , there was a transient improvement in tissue perfusion in group P , but there were no difference in complications and mortality .

OBJECTIVE	The study aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of ultrasound-guided intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid and betamethasone in the management of patients with osteoarthritis of the thumb .
METHODS	Eighty-eight evaluable patients diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the thumb ( Kellgren-Lawrence grade II-III ) received ultrasound-guided intra-articular treatment with hyaluronic acid ( 48 ) or betamethasone ( 40 ) .
METHODS	In total , 3 local injections were scheduled at 7-day intervals .
METHODS	Assessments were performed at baseline and at 7 , 14 , 30 , 90 , and 180 days .
RESULTS	In both study groups , the pain Visual Analogue Scale and Functional Index for Hand Osteoarthritis scores decreased significantly during follow-up compared to baseline .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences between the groups .
RESULTS	However , at 90 days , the functional score showed a trend towards greater clinical improvement in the hyaluronic acid group ( P 0.071 ) .
RESULTS	A subanalysis of patients with Functional Index score5 and Visual Analogue Scale score3 at baseline showed a significantly higher median functionality score in the hyaluronic acid group ( P 0.005 at 90 days and P 0.020 at 180 days ) .
RESULTS	Further limiting analysis to a baseline pain score5 showed significantly greater improvement in functionality score ( P 0.004 at 180 days ) , which was already apparent after the second intra-articular injection at 14 days ( P 0.028 ) .
RESULTS	In this patient subset , the mean pain score also improved significantly at 180 days ( P 0.02 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Both hyaluronic acid and betamethasone were effective and well-tolerated for the management of rhizarthrosis .
CONCLUSIONS	Hyaluronic acid was more effective over time and more efficiently improved functionality and pain in patients with more severe symptoms .

BACKGROUND	The management of recurrent malignant pleural effusions ( MPE ) can be challenging .
BACKGROUND	Various options are available , with the most efficacious and widely used being talc pleurodesis .
BACKGROUND	Talc can either be applied via a chest drain in the form of slurry , or at medical thoracoscopy using poudrage .
BACKGROUND	Current evidence regarding which method is most effective is conflicting and often methodologically flawed .
BACKGROUND	The TAPPS trial is a suitably powered , multicentre , open-label , randomised controlled trial designed to compare the pleurodesis success rate of medical thoracoscopy and talc poudrage with chest drain insertion and talc slurry .
METHODS	330 patients with a confirmed MPE requiring intervention will be recruited from UK hospitals .
METHODS	Patients will be randomised ( 1:1 ) to undergo either small bore ( < 14Fr ) Seldinger chest drain insertion followed by instillation of sterile talc ( 4g ) , or to undergo medical thoracoscopy and simultaneous poudrage ( 4g ) .
METHODS	The allocated procedure will be performed as an inpatient within 3days of randomisation taking place .
METHODS	Following discharge , patients will be followed up at regular intervals for 6months .
METHODS	The primary outcome measure is pleurodesis failure rates at 3months .
METHODS	Pleurodesis failure is defined as the need for further pleural intervention for fluid management on the side of the trial intervention .
BACKGROUND	The trial has received ethical approval from the National Research Ethics Service Committee North West-Preston ( 12/NW/0467 ) .
BACKGROUND	There is a trial steering committee which includes independent members and a patient and public representative .
BACKGROUND	The trial results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at international conferences , as well as being disseminated via local and national charities and patient groups .
BACKGROUND	All participants who wish to know the study results will also be contacted directly on their publication .

BACKGROUND	Reference values for plasma PTH assessment were generally established on small samples of apparently healthy subjects , without considering their 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25OHD ) status or other potential modifiers of PTH concentration .
OBJECTIVE	Our objective was to assess ranges of plasma PTH concentration in a large sample of adults , stratifying by 25OHD status , age , gender , weight status , and calcium intake .
METHODS	This cross-sectional survey is based on 1824 middle-aged Caucasian adults from the Supplmentation en Vitamines et Minraux Antioxydants study ( 1994 ) .
METHODS	Plasma PTH and 25OHD concentrations were measured by an electrochemoluminescent immunoassay .
METHODS	Extreme percentiles of plasma PTH concentrations were assessed specifically in subjects who had plasmatic values of 25OHD of 20 ng/mL or greater and 30 ng/mL or greater .
RESULTS	Among subjects with 25OHD status of 20 ng/mL or greater , the 97.5 th percentile of plasma PTH concentration was 45.5 ng/L .
RESULTS	By using this value as a reference , 5 % of the subjects with plasma 25OHD less than 20 nmol/L had a high plasma PTH level , reflecting secondary hyperparathyroidism .
RESULTS	Among vitamin D-replete subjects ( 25OHD status of 20 ng/mL or greater ) , the 97.5 th percentile of plasma PTH was higher in overweight/obese subjects ( 51.9 vs 43.5 ng/L among normal weight subjects ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The reference value for plasma PTH defined in this vitamin D-replete population was far below the value currently provided by the manufacturer ( 65 ng/L ) and varied according to overweight status .
CONCLUSIONS	These results may contribute to improve the diagnosis of primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism and subsequent therapeutic indication .

BACKGROUND	Cytokine responses accompanying sublingual immunotherapy ( SLIT ) responder phenotypes have not previously been reported .
OBJECTIVE	To investigate clinical and cytokine responses of house dust mite ( HDM ) sensitive patients with allergic rhinitis receiving HDM SLIT or placebo for 2 years .
METHODS	Sixty adults were randomized to receive SLIT or placebo .
METHODS	Clinical symptoms were measured using the Total 5 Symptom Score ( TSS5 ) and Juniper Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire .
METHODS	HDM specific IgE , IgG , skin prick tests , and HDM-stimulated release of interleukin ( IL ) 5 and interferon ( IFN - ) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was studied at 0 , 6 , 12 , and 24 months and IL-13 , IL-4 , and IL-10 at 0 and 24 months .
RESULTS	A total of 32 of 39 SLIT and 16 of 21 placebo patients completed the study .
RESULTS	There was significant clinical improvement in both the SLIT and placebo groups .
RESULTS	Median T5SS decreased from 14.75 to 5.25 in the SLIT group ( P < .001 ) and 12.7 to 6.0 in the placebo group ( P = .003 ) .
RESULTS	The median quality-of-life score also decreased in the SLIT group ( P < .001 ) and the placebo group ( P < .001 ) .
RESULTS	A subgroup analysis of patients found a 60 % or greater improvement ( on the T5SS and the Juniper Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire ) in the good responders group and a 30 % to 59 % improvement or no improvement in the intermediate responders group .
RESULTS	This subgroup analysis also found more good responders in the SLIT group ( 47 % ) compared with the placebo group ( 25 % ; P = .07 ) .
RESULTS	Significant decreases in the IL-5 / IFN - ( P < .001 ) , IL-13 / IFN - ( P < .001 ) , and IL-4 / IFN - ( P = .03 ) ratios were found in the combined good clinical improvement group at 24 months .
CONCLUSIONS	A good clinical response ( 60 % improvement in both TSS5 and quality of life ) is associated with significant decreases in IL-5 , IL-13 , and IL-4 relative to IFN - during 2 years of SLIT therapy for HDMs .

OBJECTIVE	The effects of combined oxycodone/naloxone prolonged release tablets ( OXN PR ) were investigated in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic cancer-related or non-cancer pain .
OBJECTIVE	All patients had opioid-induced constipation ( OIC ) which persisted despite substantial laxative therapy .
METHODS	This pooled analysis included 75 patients with OIC at study entry that was refractory to at least two laxatives with different modes of action .
METHODS	Patients completed randomized , double-blind treatment with OXN PR 20-120mg / day for either 12 weeks ( OXN 9001 : non-cancer pain study ) or 4 weeks ( OXN 2001 : cancer-related pain study ) .
METHODS	Analgesia and bowel function were assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form and Bowel Function Index ( BFI ) , respectively .
METHODS	Use of laxative medication and safety were assessed throughout the studies .
BACKGROUND	NCT00513656 , EudraCT 2005-002398-57 , EudraCT 2005-003510-15 .
RESULTS	Statistically and clinically significant improvements in bowel function were observed following double-blind treatment with OXN PR .
RESULTS	Mean ( SD ) reduction in BFI score was 21.2 ( 28.8 ) and comparable in patients with cancer-related ( 19.0 [ 28.9 ] ) and non-cancer pain ( 23.3 .
RESULTS	[ 29.0 ] ; P0 .0002 ) .
RESULTS	Furthermore , the proportion of patients with a BFI score within normal range ( 28.8 ) increased from 9.5 % at screening to 43.1 % at Day 15 of OXN PR .
RESULTS	While all patients used 2 laxatives of different classes at screening , during study treatment 36 % stopped using laxatives ( P < 0.001 ) .
RESULTS	OXN PR provided effective analgesia , evidenced by stable pain scores during study treatment , and there were no unanticipated adverse events .
CONCLUSIONS	OXN PR significantly improved bowel function and reduced the use of laxatives in patients with OIC , previously unresponsive to at least two different classes of laxatives .
CONCLUSIONS	OXN also provided effective analgesia for patients with moderate-to-severe cancer-related pain and non-cancer-related pain .

OBJECTIVE	To observe the difference in the clinical efficacy on oculomotor impairment between electroacupuncture and acupuncture and explore the best therapeutic method in the treatment of this disease .
METHODS	Sixty cases of oculomotor impairment were randomized into an electroacupuncture group and an acupuncture group , 30 cases in each one .
METHODS	In the electroacupuncture group , the points were selected on extraocular muscles , the internal needling technique in the eye was used in combination of electroacupuncture therapy .
METHODS	In the acupuncture group , the points and needling technique were same as the electroacupuncture group , but without electric stimulation applied .
METHODS	The treatment was given 5 times a week , 15 treatments made one session .
METHODS	After 3 sessions of treatment , the clinical efficacy , palpebral fissure size , pupil size , oculomotor range and the recovery in diplopia were compared before and after treatment in the two groups .
RESULTS	In the electroacupuncture group , the palpebral fissure size was ( 9.79 + / -2.65 ) mm and the eyeball shifting distance was ( 18.12 + / -1.30 ) mm , which were hig-her than ( 8.23 + / -2.74 ) mm and ( 16.71 + / -1.44 ) mm respectively in the acupuncture group .
RESULTS	In the electroacupuncture group , the pupil diameter was ( 0.44 + / -0.42 ) mm , which was less than ( 0.72 + / - 0.53 ) mm in the acupuncture group , indicating the significant difference ( all P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	The cured rate was 63.33 % ( 19/30 ) and the total effective rate was 93.33 % ( 28/30 ) in the electroacupuncture group , which was better than 36.67 % ( 11/30 ) and 83.333 ( 25/30 ) in the acupuncture group separately , indicating the significant difference ( all P < 0.05 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Electroacupuncture presents the obvious advantages in the treatment of oculomotor impairment , characterized as quick and high effect , short duration of treatment and remarkable improvements in clinical symptoms , there are important significance for the improvement of survival quality of patients .

BACKGROUND	In this multi-country cluster-randomized behavioural intervention trial promoting exclusive breastfeeding ( EBF ) in Africa , we compared growth of infants up to 6months of age living in communities where peer counsellors promoted EBF with growth in those infants living in control communities .
METHODS	A total of 82 clusters in Burkina Faso , Uganda and South Africa were randomised to either the intervention or the control arm .
METHODS	Feeding data and anthropometric measurements were collected at visits scheduled 3 , 6 , 12 and 24weeks post-partum .
METHODS	We calculated weight-for-length ( WLZ ) , length-for-age ( LAZ ) and weight-for-age ( WAZ ) z-scores .
METHODS	Country specific adjusted Least Squares Means with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) based on a longitudinal analysis are reported .
METHODS	Prevalence ratios ( PR ) for the association between peer counselling for EBF and wasting ( WLZ < -2 ) , stunting ( LAZ < -2 ) and underweight ( WAZ < -2 ) were calculated at each data collection point .
RESULTS	The study included a total of 2,579 children .
RESULTS	Adjusting for socio-economic status , the mean WLZ at 24weeks were in Burkina Faso -0.20 ( 95 % CI -0.39 to -0.01 ) and in Uganda -0.23 ( 95 % CI -0.43 to -0.03 ) lower in the intervention than in the control arm .
RESULTS	In South Africa the mean WLZ at 24weeks was 0.23 ( 95 % CI 0.03 to 0.43 ) greater in the intervention than in the control arm .
RESULTS	Differences in LAZ between the study arms were small and not statistically significant .
RESULTS	In Uganda , infants in the intervention arm were more likely to be wasted compared to those in the control arm at 24weeks ( PR 2.36 ; 95 % CI 1.11 to 5.00 ) .
RESULTS	Differences in wasting in South Africa and Burkina Faso and stunting and underweight in all three countries were small and not significantly different .
CONCLUSIONS	There were small differences in mean anthropometric indicators between the intervention and control arms in the study , but in Uganda and Burkina Faso , a tendency to slightly lower ponderal growth ( weight-for-length z-scores ) was found in the intervention arms .

BACKGROUND	Dietary nitrate , which is in green leafy vegetables and beetroot , decreases blood pressure through the enterosalivary nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway in healthy individuals .
BACKGROUND	Whether similar effects would occur in individuals with treated hypertension and , therefore , at increased risk of cardiovascular disease is unclear .
OBJECTIVE	We assessed whether increased dietary nitrate intake by using beetroot juice for 1 wk lowers blood pressure in treated hypertensive men and women .
METHODS	Participants ( n = 27 ) were recruited to a randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind crossover trial .
METHODS	The effect of 1-wk intake of nitrate-rich beetroot juice was compared with 1-wk intake of nitrate-depleted beetroot juice ( placebo ) .
METHODS	The primary outcome was blood pressure assessed by measuring home blood pressure during the intervention and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure on day 7 of the intervention .
METHODS	Other outcomes included nitrate metabolism assessed by measuring nitrate and nitrite in plasma , saliva , and urine .
RESULTS	Relative to the placebo , 1-wk intake of nitrate-rich beetroot juice resulted in a 3-fold increase in plasma nitrite and nitrate , a 7-fold increase in salivary nitrite , an 8-fold higher salivary nitrate , and a 4-fold increase in both urinary nitrite and nitrate ( P < 0.001 ) .
RESULTS	However , no differences in home blood pressure and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure were observed with 1-wk intake of nitrate-rich beetroot juice in comparison with the placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	An increase in dietary nitrate intake may not be an effective short-term approach to further lower blood pressure in treated hypertensive subjects .

BACKGROUND	The Oxymizer is a special nasal cannula that provides a higher luminal diameter in combination with an incorporated oxygen ( O2 ) reservoir .
BACKGROUND	It is assumed that a higher O2 concentration can be delivered breath by breath in order to increase oxygenation .
OBJECTIVE	We aimed to investigate the effects of the Oxymizer on endurance time in comparison to a conventional nasal cannula ( CNC ) .
METHODS	Forty-three patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD , age 60 9 years , FEV1 37 16 % pred . )
METHODS	and indications for LTOT were recruited during pulmonary rehabilitation for this cross-over study .
METHODS	After an initial maximal incremental cycle test , all patients performed 4 cycling endurance time tests at 70 % of their peak work rate ( twice with the Oxymizer and twice with a CNC , in reverse order ) .
RESULTS	The endurance time was significantly higher when patients cycled while using the Oxymizer in comparison to while using the CNC [ 858 754 vs. 766 652 s ; between-group difference 92 s ( 95 % confidence interval 32-152 ) , p < 0.001 ] .
RESULTS	In addition to a longer cycling duration , O2 saturation at isotime was significantly higher with the Oxymizer ( 93.5 5.4 vs. 90.4 5.3 % ; p = 0.027 ) .
RESULTS	Furthermore , there was a positive correlation ( r = 0.427 , p = 0.002 ) between the O2 flow rate and improvements in the constant work rate test , showing greater improvements in favor of the Oxymizer in patients with a higher demand for O2 ( 4 liters/min ) .
CONCLUSIONS	We show that O2 delivery via the Oxymizer is superior to a CNC with regard to endurance capacity and oxygenation during exercise in patients with severe COPD .
CONCLUSIONS	It seems that patients with a higher demand for O2 ( 4 liters/min ) , in particular , may benefit more from the use of the Oxymizer .

BACKGROUND	While acute-phase antipsychotic response has been attributed to 65 % -80 % dopamine D receptor blockade , the degree of occupancy for relapse prevention in the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia remains unknown .
METHODS	In this secondary study of an open-label , 28-week , randomized , controlled trial conducted between April 2009 and August 2011 , clinically stable patients with schizophrenia ( DSM-IV ) treated with risperidone or olanzapine were randomly assigned to the reduction group ( dose reduced by 50 % ) or maintenance group ( dose kept constant ) .
METHODS	Plasma antipsychotic concentrations at peak and trough before and after dose reduction were estimated with population pharmacokinetic techniques , using 2 collected plasma samples .
METHODS	Corresponding dopamine D occupancy levels were then estimated using the model we developed .
METHODS	Relapse was defined as worsening in 4 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Positive subscale items : delusion , conceptual disorganization , hallucinatory behavior , and suspiciousness .
RESULTS	Plasma antipsychotic concentrations were available for 16 and 15 patients in the reduction and maintenance groups , respectively .
RESULTS	Estimated dopamine D occupancy ( mean SD ) decreased following dose reduction from 75.6 % 4.9 % to 66.8 % 6.4 % at peak and 72.3 % 5.7 % to 62.0 % 6.8 % at trough .
RESULTS	In the reduction group , 10 patients ( 62.5 % ) did not demonstrate continuous D receptor blockade above 65 % ( ie , < 65 % at trough ) after dose reduction ; furthermore , 7 patients ( 43.8 % ) did not achieve a threshold of 65 % occupancy even at peak .
RESULTS	Nonetheless , only 1 patient met our relapse criteria after dose reduction during the 6 months of the study .
CONCLUSIONS	The results suggest that the therapeutic threshold regarding dopamine D occupancy may be lower for those who are stable in antipsychotic maintenance versus acute-phase treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Positron emission tomography studies are warranted to further test our preliminary findings .

OBJECTIVE	To determine the prevalence of , risk factors for , and visual acuity ( VA ) correlations with outer retinal tubulation ( ORT ) seen on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography ( SD OCT ) in eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) therapy .
METHODS	Prospective cohort study within a randomized clinical trial .
METHODS	Patients with SD OCT images at weeks 56 and 104 in the Comparison of AMD Treatments Trials ( CATT ) .
METHODS	Participants in the CATT were assigned randomly to ranibizumab ( 0.5 mg ) or bevacizumab ( 1.25 mg ) treatment and to a monthly or pro re nata ( PRN ) injection-dosing regimen .
METHODS	A subset of eyes was imaged with SD OCT beginning at week 56 .
METHODS	Cirrus 512128 or Spectralis 2020 volume cube scan protocols were used to acquire SD OCT images .
METHODS	Two independent readers at the CATT OCT reading center graded scans , and a senior reader arbitrated discrepant grades .
METHODS	The prevalence of ORT , identified as tubular structures seen on at least 3 consecutive Cirrus B scans or 2 consecutive Spectralis B scans , was determined .
METHODS	The associations of patient-specific and ocular features at baseline and follow-up with ORT were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses .
METHODS	Outer retinal tubulations .
RESULTS	Seven of 69 eyes ( 10.1 % ) at 56 weeks and 64 of 368 eyes ( 17.4 % ) at week 104 had ORTs .
RESULTS	Absence of diabetes , poor VA , blocked fluorescence , geographic atrophy , greater lesion size , and presence of subretinal hyperreflective material at baseline were associated independently with greater risk of ORT at 104 weeks ( P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	Neither drug nor dosing regimen were associated significantly with ORT .
RESULTS	The mean VA of eyes with ORT at week 104 ( 58.5 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters ) was worse than the mean VA of eyes without ORT ( 68.8 letters ; P < 0.0001 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	At 2 years after initiation of anti-VEGF therapy for neovascular AMD , ORTs are present in a substantial proportion of eyes .
CONCLUSIONS	We identified baseline features that independently predict ORTs .
CONCLUSIONS	It is important to identify ORTs because eyes with ORTs have worse VA outcomes than those without this finding .

OBJECTIVE	Patients with type 2 diabetes are generally treated in primary care setting and as a final treatment step to obtain good glycaemic control , multiple daily insulin injections ( MDI ) are generally used .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of GLP-1 analogue liraglutide on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with MDI with inadequate glycaemic control .
METHODS	Overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes and impaired glycaemic control treated with MDI were randomised to liraglutide or placebo over 24 weeks .
METHODS	Masked continuous glucose monitoring was performed at baseline and during the trial .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was the change in haemoglobin A1c from baseline to week 24 .
METHODS	Additional endpoints include changes in weight , fasting glucose , glycaemic variability , treatment satisfaction , insulin dose , hypoglycaemias , blood pressure and blood lipid levels .
RESULTS	Recruitment occurred between February 2013 and February 2014 .
RESULTS	A total of 124 patients were randomised .
RESULTS	Study completion is anticipated in August 2014 .
CONCLUSIONS	It is expected that the results of this study will establish whether adding liraglutide to patients with type 2 diabetes treated with MDI will improve glycaemic control , lower body weight , and influence glycaemic variability .

BACKGROUND	Standard first-line antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 infection includes two nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NtRTIs ) , but these drugs have limitations .
BACKGROUND	We assessed the 96 week efficacy and safety of an NtRTI-sparing regimen .
METHODS	Between August , 2010 , and September , 2011 , we enrolled treatment-naive adults into this randomised , open-label , non-inferiority trial in treatment-naive adults in 15 European countries .
METHODS	The composite primary outcome was change to randomised treatment before week 32 because of insufficient virological response , no virological response by week 32 , HIV-1 RNA concentration 50 copies per mL or higher at any time after week 32 ; death from any cause ; any new or recurrent AIDS event ; or any serious non-AIDS event .
METHODS	Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral treatment with 400 mg raltegravir twice daily plus 800 mg darunavir and 100 mg ritonavir once daily ( NtRTI-sparing regimen ) or tenofovir-emtricitabine in a 245 mg and 200 mg fixed-dose combination once daily , plus 800 mg darunavir and 100 mg ritonavir once daily ( standard regimen ) .
METHODS	This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01066962 .
RESULTS	Of 805 patients enrolled , 401 received the NtRTI-sparing regimen and 404 the standard regimen , with median follow-up of 123 weeks ( IQR 112-133 ) .
RESULTS	Treatment failure was seen in 77 ( 19 % ) in the NtRTI-sparing group and 61 ( 15 % ) in the standard group .
RESULTS	Kaplan-Meier estimated proportions of treatment failure by week 96 were 178 % and 138 % , respectively ( difference 40 % , 95 % CI -08 to 88 ) .
RESULTS	The frequency of serious or treatment-modifying adverse events were similar ( 102 vs 83 per 100 person-years and 39 vs 42 per 100 person-years , respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Our NtRTI-sparing regimen was non-inferior to standard treatment and represents a treatment option for patients with CD4 cell counts higher than 200 cells per L.
