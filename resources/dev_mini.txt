BACKGROUND	IgE sensitization to Aspergillus fumigatus and a positive sputum fungal culture result are common in patients with refractory asthma .
BACKGROUND	It is not clear whether these patients would benefit from antifungal treatment .
OBJECTIVE	We sought to determine whether a 3-month course of voriconazole improved asthma-related outcomes in patients with asthma who are IgE sensitized to A fumigatus .
METHODS	Asthmatic patients who were IgE sensitized to A fumigatus with a history of at least 2 severe exacerbations in the previous 12 months were treated for 3 months with 200 mg of voriconazole twice daily , followed by observation for 9 months , in a double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized design .
METHODS	Primary outcomes were improvement in quality of life at the end of the treatment period and a reduction in the number of severe exacerbations over the 12 months of the study .
RESULTS	Sixty-five patients were randomized .
RESULTS	Fifty-nine patients started treatment ( 32 receiving voriconazole and 27 receiving placebo ) and were included in an intention-to-treat analysis .
RESULTS	Fifty-six patients took the full 3 months of medication .
RESULTS	Between the voriconazole and placebo groups , there were no significant differences in the number of severe exacerbations ( 1.16 vs 1.41 per patient per year , respectively ; mean difference , 0.25 ; 95 % CI , 0.19-0 .31 ) , quality of life ( change in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire score , 0.68 vs 0.88 ; mean difference between groups , 0.2 ; 95 % CI , -0.05 to -0.11 ) , or any of our secondary outcome measures .
CONCLUSIONS	We were unable to show a beneficial effect of 3 months of treatment with voriconazole in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma who were IgE sensitized to A fumigatus on either the rate of severe exacerbations , quality of life , or other markers of asthma control .

BACKGROUND	Opioid antagonists ( e.g. , naltrexone ) and positive modulators of - aminobutyric-acidA ( GABAA ) receptors ( e.g. , alprazolam ) modestly attenuate the abuse-related effects of stimulants like amphetamine .
BACKGROUND	The use of higher doses to achieve greater efficacy is precluded by side effects .
BACKGROUND	Combining naltrexone and alprazolam might safely maximize efficacy while avoiding the untoward effects of the constituent compounds .
OBJECTIVE	The present pilot study tested the hypothesis that acute pretreatment with the combination of naltrexone and alprazolam would not produce clinically problematic physiological effects or negative subjective effects and would reduce the positive subjective effects of d-amphetamine to a greater extent than the constituent drugs alone .
METHODS	Eight nontreatment-seeking , stimulant-using individuals completed an outpatient experiment in which oral d-amphetamine ( 0 , 15 , and 30 mg ) was administered following acute pretreatment with naltrexone ( 0 and 50 mg ) and alprazolam ( 0 and 0.5 mg ) .
METHODS	Subjective effects , psychomotor task performance , and physiological measures were collected .
RESULTS	Oral d-amphetamine produced prototypical physiological and stimulant-like positive subjective effects ( e.g. , VAS ratings of Active/Alert/Energetic , Good Effect , and High ) .
RESULTS	Pretreatment with naltrexone , alprazolam , and their combination did not produce clinically problematic acute physiological effects or negative subjective effects .
RESULTS	Naltrexone and alprazolam each significantly attenuated some of the subjective effects of d-amphetamine .
RESULTS	The combination attenuated a greater number of subjective effects than the constituent drugs alone .
CONCLUSIONS	The present results support the continued evaluation of an opioid receptor antagonist combined with a GABAA-positive modulator using more clinically relevant experimental conditions like examining the effect of chronic dosing with these drugs on methamphetamine self-administration .

BACKGROUND	The sequencing of learning materials greatly influences the knowledge that learners construct .
BACKGROUND	Recently , learning theorists have focused on the sequencing of instruction in relation to solving related problems .
BACKGROUND	The general consensus suggests explicit instruction should be provided ; however , when to provide instruction remains unclear .
OBJECTIVE	We tested the impact of conceptual instruction preceding or following mathematics problem solving to determine when conceptual instruction should or should not be delayed .
OBJECTIVE	We also examined the learning processes supported to inform theories of learning more broadly .
METHODS	We worked with 122 second - and third-grade children .
METHODS	In a randomized experiment , children received instruction on the concept of math equivalence either before or after being asked to solve and explain challenging equivalence problems with feedback .
RESULTS	Providing conceptual instruction first resulted in greater procedural knowledge and conceptual knowledge of equation structures than delaying instruction until after problem solving .
RESULTS	Prior conceptual instruction enhanced problem solving by increasing the quality of explanations and attempted procedures .
CONCLUSIONS	Providing conceptual instruction prior to problem solving was the more effective sequencing of activities than the reverse .
CONCLUSIONS	We compare these results with previous , contrasting findings to outline a potential framework for understanding when instruction should or should not be delayed .

BACKGROUND	Patient adherence to appointments is key to improving outcomes in health care .
BACKGROUND	`` No-show '' appointments contribute to suboptimal resource use .
BACKGROUND	Patient navigation and telephone reminders have been shown to improve cancer care and adherence , particularly in disadvantaged populations , but may not be cost-effective if not targeted at the appropriate patients .
METHODS	In 5 clinics within a large academic cancer center , patients who were considered to be likely ( the top 20th percentile ) to miss a scheduled appointment without contacting the clinic ahead of time ( `` no-shows '' ) were identified using a predictive model and then randomized to an intervention versus a usual-care group .
METHODS	The intervention group received telephone calls from a bilingual patient navigator 7 days before and 1 day before the appointment .
RESULTS	Over a 5-month period , of the 40,075 appointments scheduled , 4425 patient appointments were deemed to be at high risk of a `` no-show '' event .
RESULTS	After the patient navigation intervention , the no-show rate in the intervention group was 10.2 % ( 167 of 1631 ) , compared with 17.5 % in the control group ( 280 of 1603 ) ( P < .001 ) .
RESULTS	Reaching a patient or family member was associated with a significantly lower no-show rate ( 5.9 % and 3.0 % , respectively ; P < .001 and .006 , respectively ) compared with leaving a message ( 14.7 % : P = .117 ) or no contact ( no-show rate , 21.6 % : P = .857 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Telephone navigation targeted at those patients predicted to be at high risk of visit nonadherence was found to effectively and substantially improve patient adherence to cancer clinic appointments .
CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are needed to determine the long-term impact on patient outcomes , but short-term gains in the optimization of resources can be recognized immediately .

BACKGROUND	Insufficient skills in drug dose calculations increase the risk for medication errors .
BACKGROUND	Even experienced nurses may struggle with such calculations .
BACKGROUND	Learning flexibility and cost considerations make e-learning interesting as an alternative to classroom teaching .
BACKGROUND	This study compared the learning outcome and risk of error after a course in drug dose calculations for nurses with the two methods .
METHODS	In a randomised controlled open study , nurses from hospitals and primary healthcare were randomised to either e-learning or classroom teaching .
METHODS	Before and after a 2-day course , the nurses underwent a multiple choice test in drug dose calculations : 14 tasks with four alternative answers ( score 0-14 ) , and a statement regarding the certainty of each answer ( score 0-3 ) .
METHODS	High risk of error was being certain that incorrect answer was correct .
METHODS	The results are given as the mean ( SD ) .
RESULTS	16 men and 167 women participated in the study , aged 42.0 ( 9.5 ) years with a working experience of 12.3 ( 9.5 ) years .
RESULTS	The number of correct answers after e-learning was 11.6 ( 2.0 ) and after classroom teaching 11.9 ( 2.0 ) ( p = 0.18 , NS ) ; improvement were 0.5 ( 1.6 ) and 0.9 ( 2.2 ) , respectively ( p = 0.07 , NS ) .
RESULTS	Classroom learning was significantly superior to e-learning among participants with a pretest score below 9 .
RESULTS	In support of e-learning was evaluation of specific value for the working situation .
RESULTS	There was no difference in risk of error between groups after the course ( p = 0.77 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The study showed no differences in learning outcome or risk of error between e-learning and classroom teaching in drug dose calculations .
CONCLUSIONS	The overall learning outcome was small .
CONCLUSIONS	Weak precourse knowledge was associated with better outcome after classroom teaching .

BACKGROUND	Previous investigation showed that the volume-time curve technique could be an alternative for endotracheal tube ( ETT ) cuff management .
BACKGROUND	However , the clinical impact of the volume-time curve application has not been documented .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to compare the occurrence and intensity of a sore throat , cough , thoracic pain , and pulmonary function between these 2 techniques for ETT cuff management : volume-time curve technique versus minimal occlusive volume ( MOV ) technique after coronary artery bypass grafting .
METHODS	A total of 450 subjects were randomized into 2 groups for cuff management after intubation : MOV group ( n = 222 ) and volume-time curve group ( n = 228 ) .
METHODS	We measured cuff pressure before extubation .
METHODS	We performed spirometry 24 h before and after surgery .
METHODS	We graded sore throat and cough according to a 4-point scale at 1 , 24 , 72 , and 120 h after extubation and assessed thoracic pain at 24 h after extubation and quantified the level of pain by a 10-point scale .
RESULTS	The volume-time curve group presented significantly lower cuff pressure ( 30.9 2.8 vs 37.7 3.4 cm H2O ) , less incidence and intensity of sore throat ( 1 h , 23.7 vs 51.4 % ; and 24 h , 18.9 vs 40.5 % , P < .001 ) , cough ( 1 h , 19.3 vs 48.6 % ; and 24 h , 18.4 vs 42.3 % , P < .001 ) , thoracic pain ( 5.2 1.8 vs 7.1 1.7 ) , better preservation of FVC ( 49.5 9.9 vs 41.8 12.9 % , P = .005 ) , and FEV1 ( 46.6 1.8 vs 38.6 1.4 % , P = .005 ) compared with the MOV group .
CONCLUSIONS	The subjects who received the volume-time curve technique for ETT cuff management presented a significantly lower incidence and severity of sore throat and cough , less thoracic pain , and minimally impaired pulmonary function than those subjects who received the MOV technique during the first 24 h after coronary artery bypass grafting .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate safety and evidence of efficacy of IBI-20089 , an intravitreal , liquid , sustained drug delivery system formulated with triamcinolone acetonide ( TA ) in combination with ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) for neovascular age related macular degeneration .
METHODS	Patients received a single intravitreal injection of IBI-20089 containing either 6.9 mg ( 25L ) TA or 13.8 mg ( 50L ) TA followed a week later by intravitreal injection of 0.5 mg ranibizumab .
METHODS	Patients were followed monthly and underwent best corrected visual acuity testing , slit lamp biomicroscopy , dilated ophthalmoscopy , fundus photos and optical coherence tomography .
METHODS	Patients received pro re nata dosing of ranibizumab .
RESULTS	Patients ranged in age from 59 years to 81years ( mean 73.4 years ) and all completed 1year follow-up .
RESULTS	No serious related adverse events occurred .
RESULTS	Ocular adverse events included mild , transient , elevated intraocular pressure in eight patients and cataract progression in three of the five phakic patients .
RESULTS	At 1year , 30 of a total 120 ( 25 % ) possible pro re nata re-Rx 's had been given .
RESULTS	Combination therapy resulted in a median number of 3.5 re-treatments at and including month 12 .
CONCLUSIONS	Combination therapy IBI-20089 and ranibizumab was well-tolerated and resulted in fewer ranibizumab retreatments .
CONCLUSIONS	Transient intraocular pressure elevation and cataract progression occurred .
BACKGROUND	NCT01175395 .

OBJECTIVE	To estimate age at attaining Tanner stages in Ugandan/Zimbabwean HIV-infected children initiating antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) in older childhood and investigate predictors of delayed puberty , particularly age at ART initiation .
METHODS	Observational analysis within a randomized trial .
METHODS	Tanner staging was assessed every 24 weeks from 10 years of age , menarche every 12 weeks and height every 4-6 weeks .
METHODS	Age at attaining different Tanner stages was estimated using normal interval regression , considering predictors using multivariable regression .
METHODS	Growth was estimated using multilevel models with child-specific intercepts and trajectories .
RESULTS	Median age at ART initiation was 9.4 years ( inter-quartile range 7.8 , 11.3 ) ( n = 582 ) .
RESULTS	At the first assessment , the majority ( 80.2 % ) were in Tanner stage 1 ; median follow-up with staging was 2.8 years .
RESULTS	There was a strong delaying effect of older age at ART initiation on age at attaining all Tanner stages ( P < 0.05 ) and menarche ( P = 0.02 ) ; in boys the delaying effect generally weakened with older age .
RESULTS	There were additional significant delays associated with greater impairments in pre-ART height-for-age Z-score ( P < 0.05 ) in both sexes and pre-ART BMI-for-age in girls ( P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	There was no evidence that pre-ART immuno-suppression independently delayed puberty or menarche .
RESULTS	However , older children/adolescents had significant growth spurts in intermediate Tanner stages , and were still significantly increasing their height when in Tanner stage 5 ( P < 0.01 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Delaying ART initiation until older childhood substantially delays pubertal development and menarche , independently of immuno-suppression .
CONCLUSIONS	This highlights that factors other than CD4 , such as pubertal development , need consideration when making decisions about timing of ART initiation in older children .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the effects of a patient oriented decision aid for prioritising treatment goals in diabetes compared with usual care on patient empowerment and treatment decisions .
METHODS	Pragmatic randomised controlled trial .
METHODS	18 general practices in the north of the Netherlands .
METHODS	344 patients with type 2 diabetes aged 65 years at the time of diagnosis and managed in primary care between April 2011 and August 2012 : 225 were allocated to the intervention group and 119 to the usual care group .
METHODS	The intervention comprised a decision aid for people with diabetes , with individually tailored risk information and treatment options for multiple risk factors .
METHODS	The aid was intended to empower patients to prioritise between clinical domains and to support treatment decisions .
METHODS	It was offered to participants before a regular diabetes check-up and to their healthcare provider during the consultation .
METHODS	Four different formats of the decision aid were included for additional explorative analyses .
METHODS	The primary outcome was the effects on patient empowerment for setting and achieving goals .
METHODS	The secondary outcomes were changes in the prescribing of drugs to regulate glucose , blood pressure , lipids , and albuminuria .
METHODS	Data were collected through structured questionnaires and automated data extraction from electronic health records during six months before and after the intervention .
RESULTS	Of all intervention participants , 103 ( 46 % ) reported to have received the basic elements of the intervention .
RESULTS	For the primary outcome analysis , 199 intervention and 107 control patients with sufficient baseline and follow-up data could be included .
RESULTS	The mean empowerment score increased 0.1 on a 5 point scale in the overall intervention group , which was not significantly different from that of the control group ( mean difference after adjusting for baseline 0.039 , 95 % confidence interval -0.056 to 0.134 ) .
RESULTS	Lipid regulating drug treatment was intensified in 25 % of intervention and 12 % of control participants with increased cholesterol levels , which did not reach significance when the intervention was compared with the usual care group ( odds ratio 2.54 , 95 % confidence interval 0.89 to 7.23 ) .
RESULTS	Prespecified explorative analyses showed that this effect was significant for the printed version of the decision aid in comparison to usual care ( 3.90 , 1.29 to 11.80 ) .
RESULTS	No relevant or significant changes were seen for other treatments .
CONCLUSIONS	We found no evidence that the patient oriented treatment decision aid improves patient empowerment by an important amount .
CONCLUSIONS	The aid was not used to its full extent in a substantial number of participants .
BACKGROUND	Dutch trial register NTR1942 .
